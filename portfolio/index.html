    <p>I've been creating websites and web applications since 1997. In that time I've worked with all sorts of clients, built sites using a variety of CMS frameworks as well as from scratch. I've also created many side projects and experiments to improve my knowledge. Here's some of my recent work.</p>

    <h2>The Web Is...</h2>
    <p><a href="http://theweb.is">The Web Is...</a> is a unique web conference taking place in Cardiff, Wales and timed to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the web.</p>
    <p>The website consisted of two parts, a promotional "teaser" site, and a full website for the conference.</p>
    <h2>Teaser website</h2>
    <a href="http://theweb.is/teaser"><img src="/images/case-studies/thewebis/teaser.jpg" alt="The Web Is... teaser" class="wide" /></a>
    <p>Using modern CSS, and little JavaScript, <a href="http://theweb.is/teaser">The Web Is... teaser site</a> was designed to be as small as possible while still being graphically impressive. With 3D CSS animations, inline fonts and even a full Mac Plus emulator, the site is quite unique.</p>
    <h2>Full conference website</h2>
    <a href="http://theweb.is"><img src="/images/case-studies/thewebis/thewebis_homepage.jpg" alt="The Web Is..." class="wide" /></a>
    <p>Central to this responsive site was a long main page, giving information on each aspect of the conference. It builds on the visual themes of the teaser site, introducing a strong colour pallette and subtle animations. The aim was to create an air of quality, while allowing a bit of character and fun in.</p>

    <p>Craig Lockwood, founder and organiser, also runs Cardiff's Founders Hub, Besquare.me and other great resources. He has been a terrific client to work with.</p>

    <a href="http://converser.io"><img src="/images/case-studies/converser/converser_trans_logo_large.png" alt="Converser.io" style="max-width:400px" width="100%" class="logo" /></a>
    <h2>Converser</h2>
    <p><a href="http://converser.io">Converser</a> provides an mobile app tool for businesses to create beautiful in-app messages.</p>
    <p>Working closely with the developers, I designed and built a consistently themed public website, blog site, and back-end software.</p>
    <h2>Public website</h2>
    <a href="http://converser.io"><img src="/images/case-studies/converser/converser_homepage.jpg" alt="Converser.io homepage" class="wide" /></a>
    <p>The site is modern and light, using SVG graphics to ensure it looks pixel-perfect on high-resolution displays. It's also fast, and designed to work across all sizes of devices.</p>
    <h2>Converser Blog</h2>
    <img src="/images/case-studies/converser/converser_blog.jpg" alt="Converser.io homepage" class="wide" />
    <p>The Converser blog was about giving a voice to the company, to offer insights into mobile development and trends. Set up as a Jekyll blog, it can be hosted anywhere, can withstand massive numbers of visitors without issue, and is a clean, light responsive design.</p>
    <h2>Back-end</h2>
    <a href="http://converser.io"><img src="/images/case-studies/converser/converser_dashboard.jpg" alt="Converser dashboard" class="wide" /></a>
    <p>The back-end system allows the creation of in-app communications, made up of a series of views. The editor allows for editing in-place, without relying on separate form fields and the experience is tactile and easy to understand.</p>
    <h3>Emotional design</h3>
    <p>The Converser system is designed to be both powerful while easy to use, inviting and empowering. With bright, clearly labelled actions and in-place editing of messages, the admin area is as likeable as it is useful.</p>
