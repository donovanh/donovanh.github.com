          <aside class="notes">
            Hi, I'm Donovan. I'm a front end developer working with Oisin at
            Converser, and I'm here today to talk to you a bit about an
            interesting Javascript framework, AngularJS. It's a framework aimed
            at helping people make web apps, and an interesting alternative to
            the likes of BackboneJS, Knockout and the likes.

          <h2>A Conversation</h2>
          <img src="images/conversation.png" />
          <aside class="notes">
            A few months ago we began working on a concept for a web based tool
            to let Converser customers create in-app conversations. By
            conversations, I mean a series of screens that might contain
            questions, multiple choices or images, and these conversations were
            to be sent out and seen by users of their apps. The tool needed to
            be easy to use, but able to manage multiple pages, each containing
            many separate groups of data, which had to be editable.

          <h2>First version</h2>
          <img src="images/server.png" />
          <aside class="notes">
            I'll admit, it was a bit of a mess to begin with. I tend to design
            things from the graphics down, and so I was busy thinking about
            whether we could use this or that HTML5 feature, and not as much
            time thinking about how I was to structure the data that was driving
            the app. Since a big part of the app was letting people interact and
            change the onscreen data, what I ended up doing was storing a lot of
            data in the DOM, and then grabbing all that data back out when it
            was time to save it back to the server. This brought several issues.
            The app was pretty fragile. Making changes to the way the
            interaction worked, if I wanted to say, let people add extra pages
            or remove pages from a conversation, needed a lot of very careful
            manipulation of the order of divs in the DOM. Another big pain in
            the arse was when I had massaged the data from the server in order
            for it to be presented in an intuitive way onscreen. When saving, I
            had to reconstruct the data to send it back to the server. Again,
            fragile. So naturally enough, the things we wanted the app to do
            increased, and it was clear that it would only end up becoming
            unmanageable unless I did something to separate all this data from
            the DOM and keep it in one place, ideally in a form that mirrored
            the way the server stored it.

          <h2>Frameworks</h2>
          <ul style="padding-top: 30px">
            <li>Backbone</li>
            <li>Knockout</li>
            <li>Ember</li>
            <li>... MVWTF</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            So I started looking at javascript frameworks. The first I looked
            into was Backbone.js. I'd heard a lot about backbone and it has some
            really interesting guides online. I was pretty excited about it, it
            offers a light way to separate out the models and views, and even
            set up binding between the two so that data changing in the model
            could be passed on to the views. I tried a few tutorials, tried even
            setting up a little heroku project using backbone as the approach to
            handling some onscreen data, and, well, it was OK I guess, but I
            struggled to really understand the workflow. The code seemed to make
            sense, but it just didn't quite gel in my mind enough to start using
            it. I think it was its agnostic, "do what you like" approach that
            made it more difficult to get into using it. I was too busy second
            guessing myself, not quite confident enough to make good use of it.
            Still, the problem remained, we had a lovely looking app that did
            it's job pretty well, but was rapidly becoming a maintenance
            nightmare. One evening while flicking through pages for Knockout.JS,
            Ember,js and the likes, I came across a Google project called
            AngularJS.

          <aside class="notes">
            AngularJS looked like an interesting choice. Right there on the
            homepage it had examples that seemed almost magical in their
            simplicity, data bound using almost no code. Even better, a quick
            poke around showed a pleasant looking docs section and even a range
            of video tutorials. I think it was the availability of guides that
            sold me on it, and I decided to give it a go. Well, it's been a
            month now and I've learned a fair bit, not just about AngularJS, but
            about structuring a javascript-based app. Mostly I've learned that I
            know very little. So, AngularJS.

          <h1 class="standalone">A grand aim</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            AngularJS was released a couple of years ago with a grand aim.
            Rather than be a tool to help people simply structure their data, it
            aims to allow you ways to extend what the browser does and make the
            browser behave more like something designed for web apps.

        <section>
          <h1 class="standalone">HTML is static</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            The problem it aims to tackle is that of HTML being so static and
            page-based. While the world wide web is excellent at providing
            static documents, albeit connected by hyperlinks, it's not really
            designed for single-page apps, where there's more going on than
            simply reading words or posting contact forms. Under the hood,
            AngularJS has it's got a lot to it, from binding data, to creating
            your own tags, handling multiple views and even testing. My
            experience so far has taken me into the data binding part, and a
            fair amount of time learning how it lets you create your own HTML
            tags and attributes.

        <section>
          <h1 class="standalone">Opinionated</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            Whereas something like Backbone is very light touch and lets you
            build your application exactly as you wish, there are some aspects
            to AngularJS that are more opinionated. It doesn't try to get out of
            your way. I mean, you can still use jQuery, you can throw in as much
            DOM manipulation and abuse it any way you want, but as I discovered,
            doing so can be more work than just letting Angular take care of the
            views and the data in them.

          <h1>Two-way binding</h1>
          <img src="images/twoway.png" />
          <aside class="notes">
            This is the core of what AngularJS offers. It is about managing the
            connection between where your data is stored and how it looks on
            screen. Anything else it does is about allowing ways to get that
            data into the page while maintaining this binding. Since this is so
            much the central idea of AngularJS, one of it's strengths is that it
            does this binding in a seamless, almost invisible convention based
            way. If you build things the AngularJS way, it just takes care of
            that connection for you without having to clutter up your javascript
            files with explicit connections between the data and the views.

        <section>
          <h2>Hello world</h2>
          <input
            placeholder="Give me a name!"
            ng-model="world"
            value=""
            style="padding: 8px; font-size: 24px; margin-bottom: 20px"
          />
          <h3>Hello {{world}}!</h3>
          <h4 style="text-align: left">Code:</h4>
          <pre ng-non-bindable><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;input placeholder=&quot;Give me a name!&quot; ng-model=&quot;world&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hello {{world}}!&lt;/h3&gt;
</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            Here's a little example of what I mean. Angular allows you to
            declare a model, in this case, this input text box is a model, and
            then using curly braces you can fire out the data into the view.
            When I type in this input box, the "Hello..." message is updated
            immediately. I haven't had to write a single line of javascript to
            get this to work, it's just done by telling Angular: here's the
            model, and here's where it goes. Anytime the model changes, you see
            it right there in the view. It's as simple as telling AngularJS that
            the page is an Angular app. I just added the attribute "ng-app" to
            the body tag of the page, and from then on, any curly braces in the
            html, or any of the Angular-specific attributes, are picked up by
            Angular and it does it's thing. So we have a hello world example,
            where we specify an input and specify where it is output, but what
            if you want to manage more data than that? When approaching the
            Converser app, I had these conversations with multiple pages, each
            of which had their own sets of data in the form of text, images,
            etc. All this data had to be bound to the views properly, and as
            people are going to want to edit the content and save it back to the
            system, a way to store all this data in the front end was needed. I
            needed to look into how Angular handles the model.

}

          <aside class="notes">
            While getting started with AngularJS, the first thing I did was set
            up a model for the data I was to manage. This was pretty
            straightforward. The data for the model is stored in a controller
            function, and the controller is mapped to an area of the view so
            that it knows where the data will be used and where to look for
            changes. Here's a way to show how the model is connected to the
            view. I've got a list here. The content of the list is populated by
            a little bit of Angular inline logic called "ng-repeat". Here we
            have the function in the javascript, the controller, which contains
            the data items. On the right we have the HTML that displays them.
            The HTML has in it's containing div this "ng-controller" attribute.
            This is how it knows what data to act on. If this model data on the
            left changes, the change is reflected immediately in the data of the
            displayed list. This was immediately very useful for what displaying
            multiple pages in my editor app. The pages were stored in a model
            hash, and rather than adding divs to the DOM, removing them and all
            that messy stuff, all I had to do was add an entry to the model and
            the "ng-repeat" was given the extra item to display. All very
            elegant and fast. So this is all very well when the data in your
            model is straightforward. But if you want to do more than just pass
            data back and forth? What if you wanted to manipulate the data in
            some way so that it looked different that how it is eventually
            stored by the server, but at the same time maintain this binding?
            This is where directives come in.

            <h1 class="standalone">Directives</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
              If binding is the main thing AngularJS is built around, directives
              are how it wraps the data in whatever way you want while still
              maintaining this binding. Directives are discreet modules that
              describe specific actions you want the browser to do. You can use
              directives to create your own HTML tags, specify how they handle
              the data inside the tag, both on the way from the model to the
              view and back again. I'm a bit of a slow learner. When I started
              using AngularJS, I had skimmed across the notion of directives and
              frankly, I was keen to do what I could to avoid them as they
              looked a bit scary. And they kind of are. But they're extremely
              handy, and what's great is that they can be built once, and then
              once you have the directive working, then they become tools that
              your web app can use again and again.

This is an example of a binding between a textarea and a preview div, thanks to [AngularJS][1].

          <aside class="notes">
            Actually, as it turns out, directives can be quite simple. They have
            loads of options and I've not plumbed the depths of what they can
            do, but here's an illustrative example that shows how a directive
            canhelp manipulate some data. We've got two text boxes here. The
            left is a textarea, the right is a preview. I can type a load of
            markdown here on the left, and immediately on the right, we get
            HTML. I'm using the javascript tool Showdown.js to handle the actual
            translation of the markdown, but the process of passing this
            markdown through the processor function and then putting it across
            here, is handled by a directive. First through, here's the HTML I
            used in this example:

          <aside class="notes">
            Not a lot going on here. There's a textarea with an attribute
            "markdown", and a "section" with the id "preview". So how does it
            know that this "markdown" textarea is to show it's output over there
            on the "preview" section?

            When you're initialising an Angular project, you bolt on any
            directives at loading time. What Angular does is it runs through the
            HTML looking for ways to connect these directives, and then applies
            their logic. What we have here is essentially a function called
            directive that is given two values, "markdown" which is the name of
            the function, and a function that listens for changes in the
            textarea and shoves them through the Showdown processor, and finally
            pastes the output into the preview div. This means you can create
            your own tools for handling quite complex data manipulation, and
            compartmentalise it away from the view, keeping what's in the view
            quite streamlined. The documentation on the Angular site has lots of
            examples around directives. You can bring in custom templates, even
            inject unit tests using the example code the Angular guys have set
            up, so while they are pretty complex, they're powerful.

            AngularJS comes with a wide range of directives built in. They can
            be used in the form of html tags or as attributes. Some of what we
            saw earlier, ng-show, ng-model and ng-repeat are examples. They can
            be passed parameters or data, and then act on that data while
            keeping it connected to the model.

            So what had I learned by this point. I'd learned how to set up my
            app data in a model hash, I'd learned ways to connect that data to
            the view without using much code, and I'd learned how to manipulate
            that data and present it how I want using directives.

          <aside class="notes">
            The important question is did it help. The concepts I've covered so
            far were great at achieving two things: 1) I put all the data that
            had been hanging out in various places in the DOM into one hash,
            which meant I always knew where it was. This made debugging a lot
            easier, and finding out what data was in place or missing at any
            point. 2) Better code structure. By declaring which bits of the
            model were bound to the view HTML, I didn't have anywhere near as
            many listeners that specified where the data was found, and the
            javascript became a lot easier to read and understand.

            <li>Opinionated</li>
            <li>Extendable</li>
            <li>Magical binding</li>
            <li>Growing community</li>
            <li>It does a lot</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            Which brings me to some of the benefits of AngularJS. It's
            opinionated, do it this way or else approach, is for me a benefit as
            it has resulted in a project I'd be a little more confident passing
            over to someone else, and they'd be less likely to drop dead before
            they reach the end of the file. It's been a bit of a learning curve
            for me understanding scope, understanding where the data *is* at any
            point, but what's been great is that since using it, I've found
            adding on extra functionality a much less daunting task. The data is
            always in one place, so I know that if I change the view, add extra
            directives for handling different types of data, it doesn't change
            the underlying data structure. That makes me feel a lot more relaxed
            about the code and more productive in the long run. The way
            AngularJS does it's data binding is great. I don't need to
            specifically set up listening events for each piece of data in the
            app, I know that if I ensure that the views are using Angular's
            functions for displaying the data, it'll take care of maintaining
            that binding. I've only really dipped my toes into what the
            framework can do, and it's actively developed so I'm interested in
            seeing where it goes. Since it's actively developed, I'm interested
            in seeing where it goes.

            There were moments when I was banging my head against the wall so to
            speak. Especially around the idea of directives. This could have
            been my own fault really as I'm not great at reading documentation,
            I tend to poke first, swear second then turn to the guides. However
            one thing to look out for, this had me confused for a while, was a
            few breaking changes between version 0.9 and 1.0.1. The main change
            was within directives, specifically around declaring the scope of
            the data being worked on. I'd recommend checking changelogs around
            the 1.0 mark as the videos tend to reference the older method, even
            though they're just a few months old. But yes, there is a little bit
            of learning around AngularJS. I do like it, but I'll admit I'm
            perhaps more open to giving Backbone another go as I've learned
            quite a bit in the past month about how MVWTF controllers work. The
            AngularJS website itself notes that it's not a solution for every
            problem. It's great for most CRUD style apps, but maybe not so great
            for the likes of say, an IDE, which would probably need finer grain
            control of the DOM. Having said that, I've only scratched the
            surface so I could well be wrong about that.
