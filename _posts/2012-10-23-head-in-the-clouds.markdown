A little while back, my hosting company [Slicehost][] was purchased by [Rackspace][]. While this didn't change much at first, they are now in the process of migrating accounts to Rackspace's cloud platform.

As someone who's hosting bill has been a steady and predictable bill for the past 6 years, moving to the cloud is a bit of a change. I tidied up the server last weekend and pushed through the migration to the cloud system, and now I have no idea how much it's going to cost by the end of the month.

##Nebulous billing

Cloud hosting has an interesting approach to billing. Rather than pay a fixed amount for a server with a certain amount of RAM and a maximum bandwidth allowance, you are charged for what you use. As someone who could use between 15GB and 100GB in a month but never gave it much thought, I imagine this billing style could result in surprising bills.

##Price comparison

Having been on the service for just a few days, it's looking like the cloud system will be a little cheaper. I did some quick calculations and found that rather than pay $20 / $38 per month for the basic 256MB / 512MB slices on Slicehost, it'll be somewhere between $13.65 and $28.95, depending on bandwidth.

##Investigating other options

Since I've gone to cloud with the existing server, I thought I'd look into some of the options. Aside from the ongoing cost, finding a service with a locations in Ireland was something that mattered to me. With this in mind, I set up an account with Amazon's AWS services to use their [Elastic Compute Cloud][] (EC2).

Activating virtual servers (instances) within Amazon is straightforward, but I'll get into some of the specifics of setting up a multi-domain server in another post. The interface is pretty good, with plenty of resources around to help understand the terminology.

##EC2 Pricing

This is where I'm less clear. The account I signed up for includes the use of a "Micro" instance, which is free for one year. After the year, it will be $15 per month. Bandwidth is a little cheaper than Rackspace. Rather than $0.18 per GB, Amazon charges $0.12 per GB. This would mean a total bill of between $16.80 and $27, assuming the "Micro" instance was enough to be going with.

Surprisingly, it turns out that if the Micro instance isn't enough and I need to upgrade to a "Small" instance, the instance cost increases to $60 per month (1.7GB server). An equivalent instance from Rackspace would be between $43.80 (1GB) and $87.60 (2GB). However, Rackspace offer smaller server size increases, with the next size up (512MB) costing $16 per month.

##Making the call

Thankfully Amazon allow the Micro instance to be run for a year before charging, so I plan to give it a reasonable go before making the call as to whether I'm going to need more than what the Micro can offer.
