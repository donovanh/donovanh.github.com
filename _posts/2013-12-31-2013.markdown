As we are all busy updating our footer copyright dates, I take a look back over the past year and think about what I hope to achieve in the 2014.

## 3D transforms, talks, and static sites

This year has been a big one for writing and publishing blog posts. I have found that writing about what I learn is a great way to put things into practise and make sure the lessons stick. It's also a great way to get feedback and ideas from others doing the same.

I started the year a bit late with a post in March about static website development, [The Holy Grail](/blog/holy-grail/). Using Middleman to set up and host a website on Github Pages (and Amazon S3) was an interesting diversion from the usual Wordpress and PHP based sites I'd been building before.

While working on new websites, I started experimenting with 3D in CSS. I tested this by creating a [3D iPhone with CSS](/blog/rotating-phone/). Using some `contenteditable` CSS, I demonstrated how to build a 3D box and apply some images as textures to create the 3D phone.

This got me thinking about other ways CSS could be used to create interesting 3D effects, and I blogged about some of these experiments. [Zelda - A Link to the CSS](/blog/zelda/) was all about 3D triangles and bordered text.

[Portal CSS](/blog/portal/) was an attempt to recreate a classic video game scene and made use of the way borders in CSS meet to give depth to an isometric 3D scene. I also made a [CSS Mac Plus](/blog/macplus/). The Mac Plus was originally going to be an article for [Adobe Inspire](http://www.adobe.com/inspire.html), but an [amended version](http://www.adobe.com/inspire/2013/11/3d-css.html) ended up making the publication instead.

I was also lucky enough to be asked to write for .net magazine. In issue 244 I wrote a tutorial titled [3D CSS in the Real World](http://hop.ie/cube/).

In some 2D CSS posts, I created the [iOS 7 logo](/blog/seven/) using CSS (a combination of font-face and linear gradients) and also used gradients to make great looking [CSS Balls](/blog/balls/).

I then tried some eye-crossing experiments in [Stereoscopic CSS](/blog/stereoscopic/), in which the CSS perspective-origin property was used to create more real-looking 3D scenes.

I gave some talks earlier in the year, on topics such as [AngularJS](/talks/angular-intro/), [CSS Animation](/talks/css-animation/), and I'd also been looking into Node.js (thanks to some great [Node.js meetups](http://www.nodejsdublin.com/)). I managed to record a talk in which I [introduce Node.js](/blog/node-intro/).

Towards the end of the year, I wrote about making a blog using Jekyll ([Part 1](/blog/your-own-blog-1/), [Part 2](/blog/your-own-blog-2/)) (another static website generator).

## People are so nice

It has been busy, and I've learned a lot. What surprised me more than anything else has been the response. I've had great support from some lovely people, including Zoran at [CSS Weekly](http://css-weekly.com/), Peter at [HTML5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/), Mary Lou at [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) and loads of people on Twitter.

Hop.ie has been linked to by [Jim Dalrymple](http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/11/13/css-mac-plus/), mentioned by [Zeldman](https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/400759828295217152), had articles translated into Russian and French, and linked from countless other blogs.

## 2014

I hope 2014 is as good. I expect it to. I'm helping build an interesting website for an event later in the year, and have some blogs to write about CSS transforms (including this [Photos](http://hop.ie/photos/) logo) and some canvas stuff.

In the next year I'd like to continue learning more about front-end development. Creating animated SVGs, looking into JavaScript frameworks such as Ember.js, and hopefully making more of the amazing Node.js are all on my list.

Thank you for the support. I hope 2014 is a wonderful year for you and yours.
