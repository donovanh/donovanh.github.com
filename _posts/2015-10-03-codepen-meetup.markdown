On Thursday, 1st October I met up with 15 awesome front-end developers at the first CodePen Dublin meetup. It was a great evening, and I'm really looking forward to the next.

## A CodePen meetup?

I'm a regular user of the [CodePen website](http://codepen.io), a service set up by Chris Coyier that lets front-end developers quickly build and share HTML, CSS and JavaScript demos. It can be used to mock up ideas, interactive experiments and much more. I'm a huge fan.

So when I heard they were starting meetups at various locations, it seemed only right that we bring it to Dublin. So here it is. The plan for the meetup is simple, to create a relaxed, fun evening for developers (or non-developers) to chat, connect and get to know other people in our industry.



For the moment there are no talks or other serious agenda items, the goal is begin simple and get some people together. We'll see where it goes.

The next meetup will be on Thursday 5th November, at the same location. I'll look forward to [seeing you there](/codepen-dublin/)!
