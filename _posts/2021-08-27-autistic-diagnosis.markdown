TODO:

* Summary
* Background, not taking it so seriously
* The trigger: Youtube experts (AFTI, Yo Samdy Sam)
* The diagnosis process

* What defines my autism
* Monotropism and autistic inertia
* Thinking in pictures, small talk anxiety, over analyzing interactions, selective mutism, sensory issues including bright lights(especially the fluorescent type), crowds, touch, overstimulation
* Punctuality - to the point of stressing about it. Getting places early
* Constantly having projects, feeling driven to work on them - why
* Personal deadlines / being driven and the feeling when these goals slip
* Interpersonal relationships
* Empathy and wanting to be an ally
* The need for Self-compassion
* Being aware of how other people might think differently
* How the diagnosis has made me more aware of ND behaviours in others, more empathetic to how they might feel
