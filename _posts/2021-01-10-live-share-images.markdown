First: build a simple example with live data generating graph and generating screenshot

Image:

Main website -> How it looks on social media with custom image

To cover:

* What are social share images
* Benefits of generating them
* Introducing the tech: Eleventy, Puppeteer, Github Actions
* Putting it all together (link to live demo repo)


## See it in the wild

This approach is being used on my [Covid Stats Ireland](https://hop.ie/covid-stats-ireland/) project. It means people can share the link and get useful information from the preview thumbnail. Practical, as well as cool.


## Well that's enough about me. Your turn!

Have you build a cool Svelte app you'd like to tell me about? You can message me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/donovanh), I'd love to hear from you.
